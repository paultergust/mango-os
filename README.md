# Mango OS

My try at building an Operating System.
No promises. This is for (my own) educational purposes.

The plan is to build a x86 OS. I'll be listing here the documents and resources I'm using.

- [Operating Systems from 0 to 1](https://tuhdo.github.io/os01/)
- [The little book about OS development](https://littleosbook.github.io/book.pdf)
